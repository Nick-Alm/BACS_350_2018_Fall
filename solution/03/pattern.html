<p>
    The Include Design Pattern allows you to write code once and use it many times.
</p>


<h2>Problem</h2>

<p>
    Many constructs are repeated on different pages of a website.  We need an easy way to use code that we have written
    for several different pages.  HTML provides no mechanism that will allow us to reuse HTML code.
</p>
<p>
    One place where this would be handy is in defining a standard HTML structure for every web page in our
    site.   All of the code required to start a page and the code to end a page could be packaged in a way
    that we would not have to replicate this code.

<ul>
    <li></li>
</ul>
